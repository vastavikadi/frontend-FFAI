        Knowing how to identify and treat common tomato diseases is critical for
        growing successful crops. Most common diseases are caused by types of
        fungi that favor certain weather conditions, such as excessive rain
        during cool or warm periods.

            Early blight caused by <em>Alternaria</em> fungus, is the most
            common type of leaf spot disease on tomatoes. Early blight is more
            prevalent in hot, humid regions and remains in the soil for one
            year. Wet weather can bring on an attack. In areas impacted by early
            blight, choose disease-resistant cultivars with Resistant to EB
            (Early Blight) labels.

            <strong class="font-bold">Symptoms:</strong> Dark brown spots
            encircled with rings start on the lowest leaves and move up,
            eventually causing foliage to shrivel, dry up, and fall. Lesions
            develop on stems and fruits. The defoliation causes sunscald.
          </p>
          <p class="disease-management text-lg mb-4">
            <strong class="font-bold">Management:</strong> Remove lower leaves,
            including up to a third of the infected foliage. Apply a tomato
            fungicide at the first sign of infection or when weather conditions
            are favorable for the disease to develop. Do not compost affected
            plants.

            rotate tomato plants and other nightshades every two years. Copper
            and/or sulfur sprays can prevent further development of the fungus.

            Symptoms start on older, lower leaves and move upward. Eventually
            leaves on one side turn yellow, dry up, turn brown, and fall off.
            The inner tissue of the lower stem turns red or black. Plants may
            die quickly or succumb in a week or more.

            <strong class="font-bold">Management:</strong> Treatment is similar
            for both types of wilt. There is no fungicide for wilt; remove and
            dispose of infected plants and roots. Fungus spores can remain in
            soil for many years, but this disease does not spread among plants
            grown in the same season.
          </p>
          <p class="disease-prevention text-lg mb-4">
            <strong class="font-bold">Prevention:</strong> Prevent the diseases
            by planting resistant varieties labeled VFN or FN. Keep tools clean
            and practice a three-year crop rotation. Fusarium wilt is hosted by
            pigweed and crabgrass so weed control is important. Avoid excessive
            nitrogen fertilizers which encourage disease.

            Anthracnose is a common fungal disease that causes fruit to rot.
            It's caused by <em>Colletotrichum coccodes,</em> a fungus that
            favors warm temperatures, wet conditions, and poorly-drained soil.
            The fungus is often splashed onto the fruit from the soil. It can

            The <em>Septoria</em> fungus causes septoria leaf spot. The fungal
            infection affects leaves but not the fruit. It is sometimes mistaken
            for late blight. Insects, tools, and water spread fungus spores
            which remain in the soil for up to two years. This fungus thrives in
            warm, wet weather so watch for symptoms and act immediately.
          </p>
          <p class="disease-symptoms text-lg mb-4">
            <strong class="font-bold">Symptoms:</strong> Symptoms are similar to
            early blight, but septoria more often appears at the first fruit
            set. This fungus appears on leaves as multiple small, dark, circles
            that enlarge to 1/3 to 1/4-inch in diameter. The spots develop a tan
            or gray center, and the leaves eventually wilt and fall off. It
            spreads rapidly causing loss of older leaves first, then infects new
            foliage, and can quickly move through an entire crop. Early leaf
            drop leads to fruit loss and sunscald.

            biofungicide for the entire tomato crop. Copper sprays and Serenade
            fungicide are somewhat effective at halting the spread of symptoms.
            Remove infected leaves to prevent the spread of spores to other
            leaves, as water splashing on the leaves helps transmit the disease.

            before and after working with plants, water at ground level, and
            control insect pests. Rotate your tomato crops every three years.

            In sunny regions, tomatoes can simply be burned by the sun. This
            happens more often in hotter USDA zones and after tomato plants have
            been aggressively pruned, resulting in less natural shade for tomato
            fruits.

            <strong class="font-bold">Management:</strong> Once tomatoes are
            burnt, there's not much you can do. Erect some sort of shade
            structure to prevent remaining fruits and fruits that have yet to
            emerge.

          <p class="disease-prevention text-lg mb-4">
            <strong class="font-bold">Prevention:</strong> Plant your tomatoes
            in a spot that is protected from midday sun if you live in a hot,
            sunny region. Avoid pruning too aggressively. Use management
            techniques to prevent other diseases that result in leaf loss.

            Bacterial spot is a disease that effects tomatoes and peppers in
            particularly hot, humid conditions. Multiple bacteria are known to
            cause this disease, which results in spotty, pitted fruits.

          <p class="disease-symptoms text-lg mb-4">
            <strong class="font-bold">Symptoms:</strong> Tomato plant leaves
            will develop small spots that are brown with a yellow ring around
            them. These spots often fall away and leave holes behind. Fruits may
            have scabby spots as well.

            <strong class="font-bold">Management:</strong> Do not eat infected

            Yellow leaf curl virus causes yellow leaf curl disease, causing
            leaves to yellow and curl. The leaves may be smaller than expected
            and will curl upward. Flowers are more likely to fall off, resulting
            in less fruit.

            rotation, avoiding fields where tomatoes with yellow leaf curl virus
            have been present. Practice pest prevention, as the virus is often
            spread through whiteflies.
